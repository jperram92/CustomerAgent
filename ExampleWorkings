This document explains a Python script that uses an AI-powered tool to automate the creation of a business analysis report. The script collects information such as business goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, and stakeholder analysis to generate useful documentation for project management.

Key Components of the Code
Environment Setup: 
The script loads the OpenAI API key from an environment file, which is used to interact with the OpenAI API, allowing the tool to generate and process text using AI.

Tools for Analysis: 
Several functions are defined to gather different types of business information:

Gather Business Requirements: 
Collects and formats key information like business goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, and stakeholders.

Generate User Stories: 
Transforms the requirements into user stories that describe the needs from different user roles.
Generate Functional Requirements: 
Specifies what needs to be done (functional requirements) and sets clear criteria for project acceptance.

Stakeholder Analysis: 
Identifies the key stakeholders in the project, their roles, needs, and pain points.

Agent Initialization: 
An agent is set up to process the data and use the tools defined above to analyze the business requirements and produce useful reports. This agent will run the various tools one by one, processing inputs and generating outputs in a structured format.

Inputs: The inputs provide a description of the business, such as the goals, user stories, criteria, and stakeholders. 
For example:

Business Goals: 
"To expand the product line and increase customer reach."

User Stories: 
"As a product manager, I want to create new product categories to expand product options for customers."

Acceptance Criteria: 
"All product categories should be easy to navigate, and marketing campaigns should result in a 10% increase in engagement."

Stakeholders: Two key individuals, Alice (Product Manager) and Bob (Marketing Manager), with their needs and pain points.
Results: After processing the inputs, the AI generates a detailed final report, which includes:

Business Requirements: 
A summary of business goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, and stakeholders.

User Stories: 
Clear descriptions of actions needed from different user perspectives.

Functional Requirements: 
Details of what the product should do, such as easy navigation for product categories.

Stakeholder Analysis: 
A list of key stakeholders, their roles, and challenges they are facing.
